      <p>Kris Jecen is basically a cat with an educational background in chemistry and some mechanical engineering. Equal parts analytical, artistic, and communicative, Kris is most at home when he can develop solutions that reduce suffering. Kris has lived in the Bay Area for eleven years and he is at an exciting transition point in his career: moving from the safety compliance field into web development and aiming to be involved in robotics later down the road.</p>

      <p>When he isn't practicing coding skills (<a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>), Kris likes to journal, draw, play piano, pet neighborhood cats, and watch movie trailers. While he describes himself as an introvert, Kris is very social and loves to hang out with friends as well as host parties and events at his apartment. He especially likes creating space for meaningful discussions among his friends. Kris is also a runner! He ran in Bay to Breakers for the first time this year.</p>
