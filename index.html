      <p>Kris Jecen is a full stack software developer seeking opportunies to work on paid products or services (including freemium models), or for a company with a mission to reduce suffering in some way. Equal parts analytical, artistic, and communicative, Kris would like to find a dedicated software mentor for learning best practices and sharing work experiences. His educational background includes chemistry and some mechanical engineering, and he's worked for small businesses, a multinational corporation, as well as on a fully remote international team. Ideally, his journey in tech will involve robotics down the road.</p>

      <p>When he isn't practicing coding skills (<a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>), Kris likes to journal, draw, play piano, pet neighborhood cats, and watch movie trailers. While he describes himself as an introvert, Kris is very social and loves to hang out with friends as well as host parties and events at his apartment. He especially likes creating space for meaningful discussions among his friends. Kris is also a long-distance runner (he ran Bay to Breakers 2019) and swimmer in lap pools and open water. Kris has lived in the Bay Area for eleven years, and it's really starting to feel like home. </p>
